# Epilepsy Warnings!

Are you epileptic? Do you stream Levels on Twitch or Youtube and are scared you might cause on of your Viewers to have a seizure? Then you found the right Mod!

# How it works

Using our **Databases** the Mod checks if a Level has seizure enducing Effects and **will warn you when you view a Level inside the database**.

You can view the whole database [here](https://nolananderson.dev/Epilepsy-Warnings/database.json), and you can contribute to the database [here](https://github.com/Spaceicality/Epilepsy-Warnings/tree/database).

# Why did I modify this mod?

I have had epilepsy for over a year (not light sensitivity), but I hated every seizure. I want to help the community to fixing up a mod that was a little bit broken.
